# NASA-SPACE-APPS-CHALLENGE
Project Overview: IoT-Powered Automated Earth Observation for Farmers : 

Unpredictable weather, pests, and diseases compound the myriad of water-related problems that farmers confront today. Crop health, farmer income, and food security can all be significantly impacted by these circumstances. Many farmers encounter both floods and droughts, occasionally in the same season, which makes their farming methods more difficult. With the help of this project, farmers will be able to efficiently browse, analyze, and use NASA's vast datasets by developing a platform that integrates Internet of Things (IoT) with Automated Earth Observation. Farmers may improve their farming techniques and address water-related issues by combining NASA's remote sensing data with real-time data collected from IoT sensors.

 Objectives

1. Automated Data Collection:Utilize IoT sensors to gather real-time data on soil moisture, weather conditions, and crop health, which can be complemented by NASA's satellite data.

2. User-Friendly Interface: Develop an intuitive platform that allows farmers to visualize and analyze both IoT sensor data and NASA datasets, providing a comprehensive view of agricultural conditions.

NASA Data Assets

The tool will use a number of NASA datasets, including: Soil Moisture data from the Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) satellite will be combined with IoT soil moisture sensors to provide accurate insights into irrigation needs, and Vegetation Health Monitoring data from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Vegetation Index (VIIRS) will supplement real-time data from IoT sensors to effectively monitor crop health. Drought and Flood Mapping: Satellite photography from Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) and Landsat will help assess land conditions, providing critical information for drought and flood preparedness.

 Key Features :

-Real-time data integration: Regional Leadership Data: Compile and present information from regional agricultural authorities, such as weather forecasts, soil health measures, and pest management methods. Farmer information: Allow farmers to enter on-the-ground information such as crop conditions and moisture levels into the platform. 

-Comparative analytics: Interactive Dashboard: Create a user-friendly interface that allows farmers to visualize and compare local data to regional trends and satellite observations. â€¢ Insight Generation: Use algorithms to highlight differences and similarities, giving farmers a clear picture of how local situations relate to larger trends.
